# RaylibGame
Simple game

# Build instructions
```
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
These commands should do the trick.
After the fact, there is a `bin` folder where the executable is in.
Feel free to take the bin folder outside of the build directory.

# Credits
The music is the title screen music from the open-source game Neverball.
All credits go to them,
